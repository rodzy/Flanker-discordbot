# Flanker-discordbot

Flanker is a discord bot that handles some data from the Git Cheat Sheet throught some commands managed by if statements in Go. 
I used [bwmarrin/discordgo](http://bwmarrin.github.io/discordgo/) library to connect with the discord API  

## How to use him

- Invite him to your server: [ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬ Click me!](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=703454326722396161&permissions=519232&scope=bot)
- Select the server and accept
- When he's already online on your server just type : _$help_ (This will give you an introduction and a list of commands)

## Project status

I'm currently working on some improvements on the structure of the project, trying to divide each API component into models usign Go structures. <br/>
Also I'm thinking on setting up more detailed information from git and not just from the regular cheat sheet.<br/>
*P.S: If you got a great idea on how to improve the project, feel free to make a ``Fork`` or maybe get to me I might be working on it who knows*
